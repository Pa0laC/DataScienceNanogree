## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To run the code, ensure you have the latest version of sklearn, and install the imbalanced-learn library.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using lung cancer data to better understand its different risk factors. This has led me to have a think about the following three questions:

1. Are we all equal facing lung cancer?
2. To what extent are men and women's social behaviours different and how does that affect their risk of lung cancer?
3. Can we build a strong model to predict when someone has lung cancer?




## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions:
1.  "AreWeAllEqual.ipynb" - to explore the data and answer the first question stated above. 
2.  "MenVsWomen.ipynb" - to answer the second question stated above.
3.  "PredictingLungCancer.ipynb" - to answer the final question.
Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](type link.com).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Credit must be given to Mysar Ahmad Bhat, for the lung cancer data, publicly available on Kaggle. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer?resource=download]).
